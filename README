REDADA is an interactive visualization of weighted graphs using GraphML files. It's based on flare ActionScript library (http://flare.prefuse.org/). 

REDADA exists in two versions: As a simple graph or in addition with a list of nodes showing their name and the amount of connections.

REDADA was developed for YPRODUCTIONS (http://ypsite.net/) who used it for their mapping projects REDADA ALICANTE (http://ypsite.net/redada/mapa-de-conexiones/) y REDADA MURCIA (http://www.ypsite.net/capital.reactiva/conexion/capital_reactiva.html).
